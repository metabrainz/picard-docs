========================================

You can make additional tags available by enabling the :doc:`Use track relationships </config/options_metadata>` and the
:doc:`Use genres from MusicBrainz </config/options_genres>` settings in Picard.

.. note::

   Tags will not be created and will not be available as variables if there was no value retrieved for the tag
   from the MusicBrainz database.

.. note::

   Some of these tags are only supported for certain file types or tag formats.  Please see the :doc:`Picard Tag Mapping
   </appendices/tag_mapping>` section for details.

    The sort names of the composers for the associated work.

    Tha names of the conductors associated with the track.  These can include the conductor and chorus master, and could

**releasedate**

    Explicit tag for the release date (*since Picard 2.9*).  This tag exists for specific use in scripts and plugins,
