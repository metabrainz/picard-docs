:index:`Basic Tags <tags; basic>`
==================================

The following tags are populated from MusicBrainz data for most releases, without any special Picard settings.

All of these are also available as variables for use in Picard Scripts (for tagging, for file renaming and in
several other more minor settings) by wrapping them between percent '%' symbols (e.g. ``%title%``).

.. note::

   Tags will not be created and will not be available as variables if there was no value retrieved for the tag
   from the MusicBrainz database.

   Some of these tags are only supported for certain file types or tag formats.  Please see the :doc:`Picard Tag Mapping
