:index:`File Variables <variables; file>`
==========================================

These variables are populated from information found in the audio files themselves, without any special Picard settings.

.. note::

   Variables that rely on information from the files (e.g.: _bitrate) are only available for use on
   tracks with attached files, when running scripts manually on files or in the file naming script.

.. warning::

   Prior to version 2.5 Picard did not support using file variables in tagging scripts.
