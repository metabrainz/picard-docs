:index:`Basic Variables <variables; basic>`
============================================

These variables are populated from MusicBrainz data for most releases, without any special Picard settings.

Some variables provide the :index:`MusicBrainz Identifier (MBID) <identifier; musicbrainz, mbid>` of the entity. The MBID is a 32-character identifier assigned to an entity (e.g.: artist, album, track or work) to uniquely identify the entity. For more information about MBIDs, please see the `MusicBrainz Identifier <https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Identifier>`_ page in the MusicBrainz documentation.

.. note::

   Variables will not be created if there was no value retrieved for the variable from the MusicBrainz database.

**_absolutetracknumber**

   The absolute number of this track disregarding the disc number (i.e.: ``%_absolutetracknumber%`` of ``%_totalalbumtracks%``). For example, this value would be 11 for the second track on disc 2 where disc 1 has 9 tracks. (*since Picard 1.3*)

**_albumartists**

   A multi-value variable containing the names of the album's artists. These could be either "standardized" or "as credited" depending on whether the "Use standardized artist names" metadata option is enabled. (*since Picard 1.3*)

**_albumartists_countries**

   A multi-value variable containing the country codes for all of the credited album artists, in the same order as the artists. Duplicate country codes will be shown if there are more than one artist from the same country. If a country code is not provided by the webservice the code "XX" will be used to indicate an unknown country. For example, if the first credited artist is from Great Britain and there are two other credited artists from Canada, the value would be "GB; CA; CA".

   A multi-value variable containing the sort names of the album's artists. (*since Picard 1.3*)

**_artists_countries**

   A multi-value variable containing the country codes for all of the credited track artists, in the same order as the artists. Duplicate country codes will be shown if there are more than one artist from the same country. If a country code is not provided by the webservice the code "XX" will be used to indicate an unknown country. For example, if the first credited artist is from Great Britain and there are two other credited artists from Canada, the value would be "GB; CA; CA".
