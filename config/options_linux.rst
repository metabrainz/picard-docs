=====

In Linux, Picard has a pulldown menu like in Windows for the CD Lookup option. If you're using an older version of Picard with a text field, you should enter the device name (typically ``/dev/cdrom``).

You can override this setting by clicking on :menuselection:`"Tools --> Lookup CD..."` and selecting the desired device from the list of available devices.
