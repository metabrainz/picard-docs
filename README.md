# Documentation for MusicBrainz Picard

This project was created with the intent of eventually developing a comprehensive
user manual for [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org), a full-featured,
cross-platform music file tagging system using metadata from [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org).

This project is not intended to replace the documentation on the Picard website, but to augment
it with additional detail and a structured approach.

This documentation project is open source and provided under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version
3 (GPLv3).  The documentation produced by the project is provided under the GNU Free Documentation
License, Version 1.3 (GFDLv1.3).

The project currently produces the on-line documentation in [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org)
format theme using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/). A stand-alone PDF document is also being
produced.  The latest build of the documentation produced by this initiative can be viewed on the
[web page](https://rdswift.github.io/picard-docs/index.html).
