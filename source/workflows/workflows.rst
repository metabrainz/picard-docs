Work Flow Recommendations
=========================

This section provides some recommended work flows for various tagging scenarios.  These work flows are
based on what are believed to be best practices.

The scenarios covered include:

1. :doc:`workflow_cd`
2. :doc:`workflow_album`
3. :doc:`workflow_metadata`
4. :doc:`workflow_no_info`

.. note::

   Regardless of whether or not it's one of the the work flows listed, it is **strongly** recommended
   that you make a backup copy of the files being processed and initially process a copy of your music files.
   This will help to ensure that Picard is properly configured (e.g.: settings, scripts, and plugins) and
   produces the expected and desired results.
