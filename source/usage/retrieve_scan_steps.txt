The steps to follow to scan and lookup files are:

1. Add your files using :menuselection:`"Files --> Add Files..."` or :menuselection:`"Files --> Add Folder..."`.
   For ease of use it is recommended to use the internal File Browser to manage file system interactions.  This is
   enabled from :menuselection:`"View --> File Browser"`.

2. Drag the selected directory or files to the "Unclustered Files" folder, and wait for Picard to process the files -
   the names will turn from grey to black.

3. Select the desired files and use :menuselection:`"Tools --> Scan"` to scan the files to determine their AcoustID fingerprints
   and lookup using this information. The album(s) matching the files will show up in the right-hand pane based on a "best match"
   using the Preferred Releases settings in the Metadata options.

   A music symbol in front of a track number in the right-hand pane indicates that there has been no file assigned to the track.

   If no album was retrieved, or if the album retrieved was incorrect, you may have to try a different method such as clustering
   the files or a browser lookup.
