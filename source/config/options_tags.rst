Tag Options
===========

**Write tags to files**

   Uncheck to disable Picard from writing metadata to your files. Picard may still move or rename your files according
   to your settings.

**Preserve timestamps of tagged files**

   If checked, Picard will not update the "Last Modified" date and time of your music files when it writes new tags to them.
