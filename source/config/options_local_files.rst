Local Files
===========

In this section you can configure the file names to be used by the Local Files cover art provider. The file names are defined
using a regular expression. The default is to load files with the name "cover", "folder" or "albumart" and the file extension
"jpg", "png", "gif" or "tiff" (e.g.: "folder.jpg" or "cover.png").
