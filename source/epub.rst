MusicBrainz Picard
==================

**User Guide for MusicBrainz Picard, the next generation tagger.**

MusicBrainz Picard is a cross-platform music file tagger. This User Guide is intended to augment the information
provided on the `Picard website <https://picard.musicbrainz.org/>`_ and to provide an alternate format for the
documentation, including a PDF document suitable for printing. Links to additional information such as scripts,
plugins and tutorials are provided when available rather than trying to reproduce the information in this document.
