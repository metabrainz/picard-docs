# Contributing to Documentation for MusicBrainz Picard

This documentation project only exists because of the volunteer effort that goes into its development,
from the initial documentation on the Picard website, the information posted in the
[Community Discussion Forum](https://community.metabrainz.org/), documentation from scripts, plugins
and program source code, proofreaders, editors, translators, and feedback from the user community.

Further high quality contributions are welcomed from all Picard users wanting to be part of the
open source community that creates and maintains this valuable music tool. Even if you cannot
write code, based on your experience of using Picard any help you can give to improve this
documentation further will be most appreciated - and even if you cannot improve the existing help,
if you can create or maintain translations into other languages, that would be of great benefit.

Individual contributors are not being listed here for fear of missing someone; however, please know
that your contributions are greatly appreciated.

If you want to contribute corrections or new material to this documentation project, please initiate
a [Pull Request](https://github.com/rdswift/picard-docs/pulls) against the **development** branch to
submit the changes for review and implementation.  All documentation is included in the form of
restructured text files (\*.rst) found in the *"source"* directory.  This directory also contains some
subdirectories to help organize the information into logical groups.  The *"index.rst"* file contains
the top level document index for the HTML output, *"epub.rst"* contains the index for the ePub output,
and the *"pdf.rst"* file contains the document index for the PDF output. [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)
is used to produce the final output documents.

The source documentation has been developed in the English language.  Please contact us if you are
interested in helping to work on translating the documentation to other languages, or would like to
contribute in some other manner.

Thank-you for considering contributing to this documentation project.
