"Please understand that Picard is not designed as a general purpose "
":index:`tag editor <tags; editing>`. Its primary goal is to retrieve "

"encouraging users to create an account and fix and update data via the "
"MusicBrainz website, thus sharing their work with the rest of the "
"community rather than simply fixing their tags locally."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:71
msgid ""
"To that end, Picard is likely to never have as much development focus on "
"manual bulk editing of tags as other general purpose editors (e.g.: "
"`Mp3tag <https://www.mp3tag.de/en/>`_, `foobar2000 "
"<https://www.foobar2000.org/>`_, or even many library managers such as "
"iTunes, Windows Media Player, and MediaMonkey). That doesn't mean that "
"the team won't welcome patches in this area!"

msgid "Why is saving files sometimes slow, but saving a second time much faster?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:79
msgid ""
"In most file formats the tags are near the beginning of the file, before "
"the actual music data.  If changed tags get written to the file and the "
"newly written tags take more space then before the entire file needs to "
"be rewritten. This is usually much slower than just rewriting part of the"
" file containing the tags, especially for larger files and/or if the "
"files are on a slow storage (e.g. a network share or slow external "
"drive)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:84
msgid ""
"To mitigate the issue most tagging software (including Picard) leaves "
"some free space (the so called padding) after the tags and before the "
"actual music data. If the newly written are only a bit larger than before"
" this free space can be used instead of rewriting the entire files. "
"Likewise if the newly written tags take less space than before this only "
"leads to an increase in padding, avoiding rewriting the file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:89
msgid ""
"This all means that when you add many tags to the files (or if there is "
"no or only small padding) you experience slow writing speed. If you do "
"only small changes or just remove and later re-add tags the writing is "
"much faster."

"Why does Picard not use Vinyl style track numbers (e.g. A1, A2, ...) by "
"default?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:96
msgid ""
"For Vinyl releases the track numbers on MusicBrainz are usually entered "
"as A1, A2, ..., B1, B2, ... and so on. Other releases might use even "
"different more uncommon numbering schemes.  Yet Picard will by default "
"always write decimal track numbers, starting with 1 for the first track "
"on a medium."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:100
msgid ""
"The main reason for this is that this is how track numbers are defined "
"for most file formats.  The formats expect decimal numbers, and likewise "
"music players might only expect decimal numbers when reading the files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:103
msgid ""
"If you really want to you can use the scripting variable "
"``%_musicbrainz_tracknumber%`` which always holds the track number as it "
"was entered in the MusicBrainz database.  The following script will set "
"the tracknumber tag to the value as displayed in the MusicBrainz "
"database:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:111
msgid ""
"Please be aware that for MP4 files this will result in the track number "
"not being saved, as the MP4 format does not allow for non integer values "
"in this tag.  For other formats it depends on the playback software and "
"devices you use if they can handle these non-standard track numbers."
