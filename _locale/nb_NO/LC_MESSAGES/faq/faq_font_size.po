"The usual default way to change the scaling is to rely on the settings of "
"the desktop environment, e.g. on GNOME the scaling set when configuring the "

"Setting the environment variable ``QT_SCALE_FACTOR`` will scale fonts for Qt "
"applications. This can be useful on 4k monitors. From a terminal, you can "
"then run ``QT_SCALE_FACTOR=2.0 picard`` to start Picard, or create an alias "
"in your shell, or set the variable in your shell to affect all Qt "
"applications."

"To change both the size/scaling and the font, use `qt5ct`_ to set the new "
"font and/or size. Note that these changes will apply to all Qt applications, "
"not just Picard."
