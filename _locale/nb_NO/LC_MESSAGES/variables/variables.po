"This describes both Tags which are saved inside your music files and can be "
"read by your music player, and Picard variables which can be used in Picard "
"scripts for tagging, file renaming, and in several other more minor settings."

"All tags are also available as variables, but additional variables which "
"start with an underscore '_' are not saved as Tags within your music files "
"(e.g. ``_my_tag_not_saved``)."

"Variables are used in scripts by wrapping the name between percent '%' "

"Some variables can contain more than one value (e.g. "
"``musicbrainz_artistid``), and if you want to use only one of the values "
"then you will need to use special script functions to access or set them. To "
"access all the multiple values at once, use the variable normally and Picard "
"will combine them into a single string separated by a semicolon and space (e."
"g.: \"Item 1; Item 2; Item 3\")."

"If a tag description indicates a later version of Picard than the current "
"official version on the downloads page, then the tag is beta functionality "
"which will be available in the next official release. A description of how "
"to gain access to these beta versions for testing can be found on the "
"`Picard downloads page <https://picard.musicbrainz.org/downloads/>`_ on the "
"website."
