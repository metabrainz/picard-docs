"In this situation, you will need to feed batches of files to Picard to "
"process.  In order to minimize the performance impact, it is recommended "
"to keep the batches relatively small (i.e.: approximately 200 files at "
"most in a single batch).  Picard will try to group them into clusters "
"based on the metadata currently existing in the files."
