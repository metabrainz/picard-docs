"Returns the substring of ``text`` beginning with the character at the "
"``start`` index, up to (but not including) the character at the ``end`` "
"index. Indexes are zero-based. Negative numbers will be counted back from"
" the end of the string. If the start index is left blank, it will default"
" to the start of the string.  If the end index is left blank or not "
"included, it will default to the end of the string.  If the ``start`` "
"index evaluates to a negative number (e.g.: ``text`` is \"abc\" and "
"``start`` is -10), it will default to the start of the string.  "
"Similarly, if ``end`` index is a number greater than the number of "
"characters in the string, it will default to the end of the string. "
"Invalid index values (e.g.: ``start`` greater than ``end``) will return "
"an empty string."
