"This is the preferred method of automatically identifying the album to "
"retrieve, and should be used when you have the CD or :ref:`supported ripper "
"log <faq_supported_rippers>` available. Typically this would be used right "
"after ripping the audio files from the CD.  When initiated, the table of "
"contents (TOC) is read from the CD and a request is sent to MusicBrainz to "
"return a list of the releases that match the TOC.  If there are any matches, "
"then they will be listed for you to select the one to use.  If there are no "
"matches or none of the matches are correct, you can search the database "
"manually for the matching album, and are given the option of attaching the "
"TOC from your CD to the selected release for future lookup."
