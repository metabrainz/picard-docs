"When checked, Picard will check each of the selected locales in order to see "
"whether an artist has an alias for that locale. If it does, Picard will use "
"that alias instead of the artist name when tagging. For example, if you have "
"selected locales of \"English (Canadian)\" and \"English (US)\", and there "
"are aliases for \"English (US)\", \"English\" and \"Greek\", then the "
"\"English (US)\" alias will be used."

"the name belongs to each script. Then each of your selected scripts are "
