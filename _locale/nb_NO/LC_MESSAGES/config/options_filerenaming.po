"If selected, this option tells Picard to move your audio files to a new "
"directory when it saves them. One use for this is to keep your work "
"organized: all untagged files are under \"Directory A\", and when Picard "
"tags them it moves them to \"Directory B\". When \"Directory A\" is empty, "
"your tagging work is done."

"The \"Rename Files\" and \"Move Files\" options are independent of one "
"another. \"Rename Files\" refers to Picard changing file names, typically "
"based on artist and track names. \"Move Files\" refers to Picard moving "
"files to new directories, based on a specified parent directory and "
"subdirectories, typically based on album artist name and release title. "
"However, they both use the same \"file naming string\". \"Move files\" uses "
"the portion up until the last '/'. \"Rename files\" uses the portion after "
"the last '/'."

"When these additional files are moved they will end up in the release "

"This option can also be used to move subdirectories to the new release "

"subfolder called \"Artwork\", \"covers\" or \"scans\" that contains "
"additional image files that you also want to move to the new release "
"directory, simply add \"artwork\", \"covers\" and \"scans\" to the list of "
