"This provider uses the Cover Art Archive cover image assigned to the release "
"group. This is usually the image that best describes the release group as a "
"whole or the image with the best visual quality, but is not necessarily the "
"exact cover of the release you are tagging. This provider is a good choice "
"if you care more about visual quality then having an exact representation of "
"your release. It is also a good fallback for the Cover Art Archive provider."
