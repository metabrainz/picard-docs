msgid "If you find that Picard won't start there are a few common possible reasons, and things to try to correct the issue. Before doing anything drastic, it is recommended that you try to start Picard from the command line with the :option:`-d` option to generate the debug logging.  This process is described in the :doc:`troubleshooting` section.  If the resulting logs don't provide any clues as to the problem, it may be one of the following:"

Since you won't be able to disable or remove the plugins using Picard's 'Option' settings, you will need to remove them manually.  The plugins may be located in a ``plugins`` subdirectory of the directory where the Picard program file is stored, or in a user-specific directory:"

In that case, you should first try to reinstall the previous version to ensure that it works and that the problem is only occurring with the new version.  Then you should report the issue, following the steps outlined in the \"Reporting a Bug\" topic of the :doc:`troubleshooting` section.  Please be sure to include as much information as possible, which will help the developers to locate and fix the problem."
