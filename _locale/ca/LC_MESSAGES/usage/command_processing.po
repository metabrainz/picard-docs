msgid "As of version 2.9, Picard will try to only run a single instance of the program at a time. When the program is started, it checks to see if there is another instance of that version, configuration file and plugin startup status ``-P`` already running.  If the same version is already running, any files or directories specified on the command line of the new instance, along with any executable commands specified with the ``-e`` or ``-exec`` options will be passed to the already running instance for processing and the new duplicate instance will be shut down.  This allows batch processing of files to be initiated automatically from other processes.  If there is no instance of that version already running, Picard will start normally."
