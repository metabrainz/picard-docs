msgid "How Option Profiles Work"
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:11
msgid ""
"A profile is defined by a set of options it manages. For example, one "
"profile may include settings for file naming such as the target directory "
"and which file naming script to use, while another profile may include "
"different settings for the same options or different options entirely (or "
"some of each). Profiles are stacked and processed in the order specified by "
"the user, from top to bottom with the lowest level being the system's \"user "
"settings\" profile. Each user-defined profile can be enabled or disabled "
"independently from the other user-defined profiles. The system's \"user "
"settings\" profile is always enabled and includes all options."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:13
msgid ""
"When an option value is retrieved as part of Picard's processing, it comes "
"from the first enabled profile in the stack that manages that option. "
"Initially, the profile stack contains only the system's \"user settings\" "
"profile, which holds the default settings for the user."

"For this example, the user would like to define a set of options with "
"alternate values, in this case a target directory where audio files are "
"saved (option ``move_files_to``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:20
msgid ""
"The user creates a new profile (named \"TargetMyDir\"), adds the option "
"``move_files_to`` to it, and enables this profile. The stack is now:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:28
msgid ""
"They change the value of ``move_files_to`` (to \"target_my_dir\") for this "
"new profile."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:30
msgid ""
"Since the profile \"TargetMyDir\" is enabled, the value for "
"``move_files_to`` is retrieved from this profile. The \"user settings\" "
"still has the old ``move_files_to`` value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:32
msgid ""
"Now the user wants to work on another set of music files, wanting to disable "
"``windows_compatibility`` for this set and save them to the "
"\"not_for_windows\" directory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:34
msgid ""
"They create a new profile (named \"ByeByeWin\"), add options "
"``move_files_to`` and ``windows_compatibility``, and enable it. Now the "
"stack looks like:"

"They change the values of ``move_files_to`` (to \"not_for_windows\") and "

"process their files, the files are saved to the \"ByeByeWin\" "
"``move_files_to`` directory, with ``windows_compatibility`` = false."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:44
msgid ""
"Now the user wants to save files to the \"TargetMyDir\" target directory "
"again, with their usual options. To do this they simply disable the "
"\"ByeByeWin\" profile (which can later be re-enabled if needed). The stack "
"looks like:"

"Finally, to return to their usual output directory the user only has to "

"All option profile management is done within the Option Profiles page "

"Initially, the list of profiles will be empty. To create a new profile click "

"the profile name and select the :menuselection:`\"Rename profile\"` command. "
"The list of options that the profile is to manage are selected from the list "

"The profile stack order can be rearranged either by selecting a profile and "

"L'ordre de la llista de perfils es pot canviar seleccionant un perfil i fent "

"Changes made to a profile's options settings, enabled status, or position in "
"the profile stack will be reflected in the option settings displayed on the "
"other pages. Options that are controlled by an enabled profile will be shown "
"as highlighted. Hovering your cursor over the highlighted option will "
"identify which profile currently controls the setting. Settings are always "
"displayed based on the first enabled profile in the profile stack, which "
"corresponds to the setting that will be used during processing."

"Els canvis aplicats als paràmetres d'un perfil d'opcions, l'estat "
"d'habilitació o la posició a la llista de perfils es reflectiran als "
"paràmetres que es mostren a la resta de pàgines. Les opcions controlades per "
"un perfil habilitat es mostraran ressaltades. Si passeu el cursor sobre "
"l'opció ressaltada, podreu identificar quin perfil controla el paràmetre "
