msgid "How Option Profiles Work"
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:11
msgid "A profile is defined by a set of options it manages.  For example, one profile may include settings for file naming such as the target directory and which file naming script to use, while another profile may include different settings for the same options or different options entirely (or some of each).  Profiles are stacked and processed in the order specified by the user, from top to bottom with the lowest level being the system's \"user settings\" profile.  Each user-defined profile can be enabled or disabled independently from the other user-defined profiles.  The system's \"user settings\" profile is always enabled and includes all options."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:18
msgid "When an option value is retrieved as part of Picard's processing, it comes from the first enabled profile in the stack that manages that option. Initially, the profile stack contains only the system's \"user settings\" profile, which holds the default settings for the user."

msgid "For this example, the user would like to define a set of options with alternate values, in this case a target directory where audio files are saved (option ``move_files_to``)."

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:28
msgid "The user creates a new profile (named \"TargetMyDir\"), adds the option ``move_files_to`` to it, and enables this profile. The stack is now:"

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:37
msgid "They change the value of ``move_files_to`` (to \"target_my_dir\") for this new profile."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:39
msgid "Since the profile \"TargetMyDir\" is enabled, the value for ``move_files_to`` is retrieved from this profile.  The \"user settings\" still has the old ``move_files_to`` value."

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:82
msgid "Initially, the list of profiles will be empty.  To create a new profile click on the :guilabel:`New` button.  This will create a profile with no options selected for the profile to manage.  To rename the profile, right-click on the profile name and select the :menuselection:`\"Rename profile\"` command.  The list of options that the profile is to manage are selected from the list in the right-hand pane.  Options can be selected either by group or individually.  The groups can be expanded to see the individual options belonging to that group."

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:97
msgid "The profile stack order can be rearranged either by selecting a profile and using the up and down arrow buttons below the list, or by dragging the profile to a new position in the stack.  Profiles are enabled when the box beside the profile's name is checked."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:101
msgid "Changes made to a profile's options settings, enabled status, or position in the profile stack will be reflected in the option settings displayed on the other pages. Options that are controlled by an enabled profile will be shown as highlighted. Hovering your cursor over the highlighted option will identify which profile currently controls the setting. Settings are always displayed based on the first enabled profile in the profile stack, which corresponds to the setting that will be used during processing."

#: ../../usage/option_profiles.rst:107

If an option is managed by one or more profiles that are currently enabled, the option will be highlighted and it will be saved to the **first** enabled profile in the profile stack that manages the option. If there are no enabled profiles that manage the option, the option will not be highlighted and it will be saved to the \"user settings\" profile which is the user's normal settings, contains all options, is at the bottom of the profile stack, and is always enabled.  The \"user settings\" profile cannot be modified is not shown in the profile management page."
