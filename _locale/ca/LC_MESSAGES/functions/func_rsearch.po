"When entering regular expressions into Picard scripts you have to escape a "
"backslash \"\\\\\", dollar sign \"$\", comma \",\" and the left and right "
"parentheses \"(\" and \")\" in order to force Picard to not interpret them "
"as part of the script command. This is done by inserting a backslash before "
"the character to be escaped. For example, the regular expression "
"``^\\s*([0-9,\\.]*)$`` would have to be entered as ``^\\\\s*\\([0-9\\,\\"
"\\.]*\\)\\$``."
