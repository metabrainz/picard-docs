Often these are discussed on the `Community Discussion Forum <https://community.metabrainz.org/>`_ so if you're looking for a particular enhancement or functionality, a search there might be useful.  In addition, one of the MusicBrainz editors, `Colby Ray <https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/User:Colbydray>`_ maintains an unofficial list of available plugins on a `wiki page <https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/User:Colbydray/PicardPlugins>`_.
