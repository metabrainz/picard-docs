The mask should not contain a file extension; this is added automatically based on the actual image type. The default value is \"cover\".

If the image has been assigned multiple types, then the first type will be used. For example, if the image is of types \"back\" and \"raw\", then \"back\" will be used for the filename. If unchecked or if the image is of type \"front\", Picard will use the file name specified in the \"Use the following file name for images\" setting."
