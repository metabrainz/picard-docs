msgstr ""

#: ../../config/options_matching.rst:33
msgid "This setting is used when a file is assigned to a release and Picard needs to decide which track to assign it to. This happens on cluster lookup after the release has been chosen, or if you manually drag files onto a loaded release (as opposed to dragging it onto a track directly). If none of the tracks gives a match above the threshold the file is moved into an \"unmatched files\" section on that release."
msgstr ""

#: ../../config/options_matching.rst:39
msgid "If you have absolutely no metadata in your current files, and you are using \"Scan\" to match tracks, you may find that you need to lower the value of \"Minimal similarity for matching files to tracks\" in order for Picard to match the files within a release. Otherwise you may find that Picard matches the track to a release but then is not sure which track is correct; and leaves it in an \"unmatched files\" group within that release."

msgid "As a general rule, lowering the percentages may increase the chance of finding a match at the risk of false positives and incorrect matches."
