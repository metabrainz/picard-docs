msgid "If selected, this option tells Picard to move your audio files to a new directory when it saves them. One use for this is to keep your work organized: all untagged files are under \"Directory A\", and when Picard tags them it moves them to \"Directory B\". When \"Directory A\" is empty, your tagging work is done."

msgid "The \"Rename Files\" and \"Move Files\" options are independent of one another. \"Rename Files\" refers to Picard changing file names, typically based on artist and track names. \"Move Files\" refers to Picard moving files to new directories, based on a specified parent directory and subdirectories, typically based on album artist name and release title. However, they both use the same \"file naming string\". \"Move files\" uses the portion up until the last '/'. \"Rename files\" uses the portion after the last '/'."

If you use the directory \".\" the files will be moved relative to their current location. If they are already in some sort of directory structure, this will probably not do what you want!"

#: ../../config/options_filerenaming.rst:63
msgid "This option can also be used to move subdirectories to the new release directory.  This is done by specifying the name of the subdirectory in the list of files to be moved. For example, if your album folders have a subfolder called \"Artwork\", \"covers\" or \"scans\" that contains additional image files that you also want to move to the new release directory, simply add \"artwork\", \"covers\" and \"scans\" to the list of additional file matching patterns."

Checking this box may be convenient if you are using the \"move files\" option to organize your work. An empty directory has no more work for you to do, and deleting the directory makes that clear."
