#: ../../extending/scripting.rst:24
msgid "The syntax is derived from `Foobar2000's titleformat <https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Foobar2000:Titleformat_Reference>`_. There are three base elements: text, variable and function. Variables consist of alphanumeric characters enclosed in percent signs (e.g.: ``%artist%``). Functions start with a dollar sign and end with an argument list enclosed in parentheses (e.g.: ``$lower(...)``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../extending/scripting.rst:33
msgid "When entering input strings into Picard scripts you have to escape a backslash \"\\\\\", dollar sign \"$\", comma \",\" and the left and right parentheses \"(\" and \")\" in order to force Picard to not interpret them as part of the script command.  This is done by inserting a backslash before the character to be escaped.  For example, to set a tag value to ``($1,000,000)`` it would have to be entered as ``$set(test_tag,\\(\\$1\\,000\\,000\\))``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../extending/scripting.rst:41
msgid "Usually you can access the values of a tag by the proper variable name. For example, if your tag is called \"rerecorded\" you can use ``%rerecorded%``. But the hyphen is not a valid character for a script variable, so ``%re-recorded%`` gives a syntax error. In cases like this you need to use ``$get(re-recorded)``."

In scripts, multi-value variables are automatically converted to a single text string by joining the values with a semicolon \";\", except when used with special multi-value functions."
