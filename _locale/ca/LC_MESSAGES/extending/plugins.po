"Plugins are written in Python, and are registered to the appropriate hooks. "
"Each plugin has its own version identifier, but also lists the plugin API "
"versions that it supports. When loading a plugin, Picard first compares its "
"list of API versions to the plugin's supported versions to ensure that the "
"plugin will operate correctly. The Picard API versions indicate the version "
"of the program in which the plugin API was last updated and any plugin APIs "
"with which it is backwards compatible."

"Hooks are connections to the various objects in Picard that call a specific "
"type of plugin. During the normal running of Picard, when it encounters a "
"hook it will first retrieve a list of all plugins registered for that "
"specific hook, and then execute them sequentially in order based upon the "
"priority specified when the plugin was registered to the hook."

"There are a few different :index:`types of plugins <plugins; types>`, "
"including:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../extending/plugins.rst:12
msgid ""
"**Metadata processors**: These plugins can access and modify the metadata "
"when it is loaded from MusicBrainz. They are registered with "
"``register_album_metadata_processor()`` or "
"``register_track_metadata_processor()``. These are what you might call "
"\"automatic\" because they operate without any user intervention. An example "
"is the Classical Extras plugin."
msgstr ""

#: ../../extending/plugins.rst:14
msgid ""
"**Cover art providers**: These plugins provide another cover art source, and "
"are registered with ``register_cover_art_provider()``. They are also "
"\"automatic\" in that they load album art without user intervention, "
"although they must be enabled by the user in the Cover Art options. The "
"Fanart.tv plugin is an example."

#: ../../extending/plugins.rst:16
msgid ""
"**Scripting function**: Some plugins just provide additional scripting "
"functions for use in :menuselection:`\"Options --> Scripting\"` or the "
"renaming script. These are registered with ``register_script_function()``. "
"Keep tag, which provides the ``$keep()`` function, is an example."

#: ../../extending/plugins.rst:18
msgid ""
"**Context menu actions**: Plugins can register actions that can be activated "
"manually via the context menu. This is what the Load as non-album track "
"plugin does. Another example is Generate Cuesheet. These are registered with "
"``register_album_action()``, ``register_track_action()``, "
"``register_file_action()``, ``register_cluster_action()`` or "
"``register_clusterlist_action()``."

#: ../../extending/plugins.rst:20

"**File formats**: Plugins can also provide support for new file formats not "
"yet supported by Picard. These are registered with ``register_format()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../extending/plugins.rst:22
msgid ""
"**Event processors**: Plugins can execute automatically based on certain "
"event triggers. These are registered with ``file_post_load_processor()``, "
"``file_post_save_processor()``, ``file_post_addition_to_track_processor()``, "
"``file_post_removal_from_track_processor()`` or "
"``album_post_removal_processor()``."

"Note that plugins are not limited to one of those areas. A single plugin "
"could implement all of the above, but most existing plugins focus on one."

"Plugin V3 Documentation <https://github.com/metabrainz/picard/blob/master/"

"is also a list of the `available plugins <https://picard.musicbrainz.org/"
"plugins/>`_ that have been submitted to the MusicBrainz Picard repository "
