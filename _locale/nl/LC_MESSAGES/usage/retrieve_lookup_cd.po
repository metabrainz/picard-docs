"Make sure the CD is inserted in the drive, and select :menuselection:"
"`\"Tools --> Lookup CD... --> (drive to use)\"`. The CD TOC will be "
"calculated and sent to MusicBrainz. Alternately, you can use a :ref:"
"`supported ripper log file <faq_supported_rippers>` to lookup the CD using "
"the :menuselection:`\"Tools --> Lookup CD --> From CD ripper log file...\"` "
"command. This will open a file browser dialog to allow you to select the log "
"file to process. Either method will query the MusicBrainz database and "
"display a list of matching releases."
