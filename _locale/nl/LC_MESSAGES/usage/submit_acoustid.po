"Acoustic fingerprints are very useful for identifying tracks and recordings, "
"allowing them to be looked up in the MusicBrainz database. Thus, it is very "
"valuable to add them when you are tagging files.  Note that an acoustic "
"fingerprint is **not** an AcoustID. Please see the :doc:`/tutorials/"
"acoustid` tutorial for additional information."

"When using Picard to submit acoustic fingerprints, it is recommended to "
"enable the Fingerprint column in the table view in the right-hand pane.  "
"This is done by right-clicking the column header and checking the box beside "
"\"Fingerprint status\".  This will display an icon indicating whether the "
"AcoustID was calculated and whether it ready for submission (red = "
"unsubmitted, grey = already submitted)."

"There are two methods for submitting acoustic fingerprints, depending on the "
"workflow that you are using to identify the releases that you are tagging. "
"Note that both methods require that you first match your audio files to "
"release and track information from the MusicBrainz database. See the :doc:"
"`retrieve` and :doc:`match` sections for more information about retrieving "
"release information and matching audio files to releases."
