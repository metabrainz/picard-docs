"Each plugin that works with an album or track's metadata has their various "
"processing functions registered with an execution priority set by the plugin "
"author within the plugin itself. A plugin may contain multiple different "
"processing functions, each with its own specified priority. These priorities "
"determine the order in which the functions are executed, and are generally "
"set as high, normal or low."

"Most of the time this grouping of execution priorities is sufficient, "
"however there may be a situation where one plugin processing function must "
"be executed before another plugin function with the same priority in order "
"to avoid unintended results. This option setting allows you to specify the "
"order that the plugin metadata processing functions are executed, regardless "
"of the initial registered priority for the function. In this way, you can "
"avoid unexpected results that might otherwise occur."

"When the execution order editor is opened, it will display all of the "
"enabled plugin metadata processing functions in the order in which they are "
"executed by Picard. You can change the order by moving the plugin processing "
"functions up or down by selecting the function to move and then use the up "
"or down button, or by using your mouse to drag the function to the desired "
"location in the list. There is also an option to reset the order to that "
"which was determined by the original plugin settings."

"Hovering your cursor over a plugin's name will display a description of the "
"function, and hovering over a plugin's processing function will display a "

"When you save your changes, they will be applied immediately and do not "
"depend on clicking the :guilabel:`Make It So!` button. Similarly, clicking "
"the :guilabel:`Cancel`, :guilabel:`Restore Defaults` or :guilabel:`Restore "
"all Defaults` buttons on the main Plugins option page will not change the "
"plugin execution order saved perviously."
