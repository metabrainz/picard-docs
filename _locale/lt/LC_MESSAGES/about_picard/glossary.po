#: ../../about_picard/glossary.rst:52
msgid "An :index:`artist credit` indicates who is the main credited artist (or artists) for releases, release groups, tracks and recordings, and how they are credited. They consist of artists, with (optionally) their names as credited in the specific release, track, etc., and join phrases between them.  For example, on the release \"`Love Sponge <https://musicbrainz.org/release/6ca797fd-8f3a-4326-bdc7-f805cb2de088>`_\" the artist is \"`Walk off the Earth <https://musicbrainz.org/artist/e2a5eaeb-7de7-4ffe-a519-e18e427a5060>`_\" but is credited as \"Gianni and Sarah\"."

msgid "**disc id**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../about_picard/glossary.rst:75
msgid "A :index:`Disc ID <disc id>` is the code number which MusicBrainz uses to link a physical CD to a release listing. It is a string of letters, like ``XzPS7vW.HPHsYemQh0HBUGr8vuU-``.  Disc IDs for a release can be seen on the disc IDs tab for the release on MusicBrainz. Clicking on these will give a detailed display of the disc ID, including the list of attached releases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about_picard/glossary.rst:80
msgid "A release may have any number of disc IDs, and a disc ID may be linked to multiple releases. This is because `disc ID calculation <https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Disc_ID_Calculation>`_ involves a hash of the frame offsets of the CD tracks.  Different pressing of a CD often have slightly different frame offsets, and hence different disc IDs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about_picard/glossary.rst:85
msgid "Conversely, two different CDs may happen to have exactly the same set of frame offsets and hence the same disc ID.  For example ``lwHl8fGzJyLXQR33ug60E8jhf4k-`` applies to a wide `variety of releases <https://musicbrainz.org/cdtoc/lwHl8fGzJyLXQR33ug60E8jhf4k->`_ by a variety of artists."

#: ../../about_picard/glossary.rst:100
msgid ":index:`One <medium>` of the physical, separate things you would get when you buy something in a record store. They are the individual CDs, vinyls, etc. contained within the packaging of an album (or any other type of release). Mediums are always included in a release, and have a position in said release (e.g. disc 1 or disc 2). They have a format like CD, 12\" vinyl or cassette (in some cases this will be unknown), and can have an optional title (e.g. disc 2: The Early Years). For example, CD 1 of \"`The Wall <https://musicbrainz.org/release/4bd2dbd5-a961-335a-a618-39c26b2ee791#disc1>`_\"."

#: ../../about_picard/glossary.rst:116
msgid "An entity in MusicBrainz which can be linked to tracks on releases. Each track must always be associated with a single :index:`recording`, but a recording can be linked to any number of tracks. For example, this recording of \"`Bohemian Rhapsody <https://musicbrainz.org/recording/b1a9c0e9-d987-4042-ae91-78d6a3267d69>`_\" is found as a track on over 100 releases."

msgstr ""

#: ../../about_picard/glossary.rst:135
msgid "Groups several different releases into a single logical entity. Every release belongs to one, and only one :index:`release group`. Both release groups and releases are \"albums\" in a general sense, but with an important difference: a release is something you can buy as media such as a CD or a vinyl record, while a release group embraces the overall concept of an album â€” it doesn't matter how many CDs or editions / versions it had.  For example the `\"Sea of No Cares\" <https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/7e7ffd2b-3d1b-3487-aaaf-e4e6037f09ca>`_ release group contains multiple releases."

msgid ":index:`A distinct intellectual or artistic creation <work>`, which can be expressed in the form of one or more audio recordings. While a 'Work' in MusicBrainz is usually musical in nature, it is not necessarily so. A work could also be a novel, play, poem or essay, later recorded as an oratory or audiobook. For example, the song \"`Blinded by the Light <https://musicbrainz.org/work/7a757d97-da2a-3751-8d32-94d471de2eeb>`_\" written by Bruce Springsteen has been recorded well over 100 times."
