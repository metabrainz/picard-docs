msgid "Acoustic fingerprints are very useful for identifying tracks and recordings, allowing them to be looked up in the MusicBrainz database. Thus, it is very valuable to add them when you are tagging files.  Note that an acoustic fingerprint is **not** an AcoustID. Please see the :doc:`/tutorials/acoustid` tutorial for additional information."

#: ../../usage/submit_acoustid.rst:13
msgid "When using Picard to submit acoustic fingerprints, it is recommended to enable the Fingerprint column in the table view in the right-hand pane.  This is done by right-clicking the column header and checking the box beside \"Fingerprint status\".  This will display an icon indicating whether the AcoustID was calculated and whether it ready for submission (red = unsubmitted, grey = already submitted)."

msgid "There are two methods for submitting acoustic fingerprints, depending on the workflow that you are using to identify the releases that you are tagging. Note that both methods require that you first match your audio files to release and track information from the MusicBrainz database. See the :doc:`retrieve` and :doc:`match` sections for more information about retrieving release information and matching audio files to releases."
