Alternately, you can use a :ref:`supported ripper log file <faq_supported_rippers>` to lookup the CD using the :menuselection:`\"Tools --> Lookup CD --> From CD ripper log file...\"` command. This will open a file browser dialog to allow you to select the log file to process. Either method will query the MusicBrainz database and display a list of matching releases."
