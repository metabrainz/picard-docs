"As of version 2.9, Picard will try to only run a single instance of the "
"program at a time. When the program is started, it checks to see if there is "
"another instance of that version, configuration file and plugin startup "
"status ``-P`` already running. If the same version is already running, any "
"files or directories specified on the command line of the new instance, "
"along with any executable commands specified with the ``-e`` or ``-exec`` "
"options will be passed to the already running instance for processing and "
"the new duplicate instance will be shut down. This allows batch processing "
"of files to be initiated automatically from other processes. If there is no "
"instance of that version already running, Picard will start normally."
