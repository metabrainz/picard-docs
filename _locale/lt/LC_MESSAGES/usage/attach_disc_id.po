msgid "Make sure the CD is inserted in the drive, and select :menuselection:`\"Tools --> Lookup CD... --> (drive to use)\"`. The CD toc will be calculated and sent to MusicBrainz. Alternately, you can use an EAC, XLD or Whipper ripper log file to lookup the CD using the :menuselection:`\"Tools --> Lookup CD --> From EAC / XLD / Whipper log file...\"` command. This will open a file browser dialog to allow you to select the log file to process. Either method will query the MusicBrainz database and display a list of matching releases."

If there are no matches found or the desired target release does not appear in the list, use the :menuselection:`\"Submit disc ID\"` option to locate the correct release.  Enter the release title or artist and initiate the search.  You will be provided with a list of the releases that match your search criterion and have the same number of tracks as your CD TOC."
