"Some releases, especially digital releases, can have a very long list of "
"release countries, sometimes listing all of the world's countries except for "
"a few where the release is not officially available. Picard offers some "

"By default Picard will write a single ``releasecountry`` tag to the files. "
"Prior to v2.3.1, Picard had been populating the tag with what the "
"MusicBrainz server returned as the country for the release. If there were "
"multiple release events, this country field was just filled with the first "
"one in alphabetical order (Afghanistan in our example). Picard v2.3.1 "
"introduced some options to better handle this."

"If you configure preferred release countries in :menuselection:`\"Options --"
"> Metadata --> Preferred Releases\"`. Picard will use the first country from "
"the preferred release countries that is also in the list of release events. "
"So if you have configured preferred release countries to be Europe, Canada, "
"Germany and UK, for our example that would mean the ``releasecountry`` tag "
"gets set to Canada."

"Picard v2.3.1 also added a new variable ``%_releasecountries%``, which "
"provides the complete list of release countries for a release as a multi-"
"value variable. You can use this to set different values for the "
"``releasecountry`` tag."

"For example, the following script would set it to \"\\[International\\]\" if "

"Of course you can adjust the count and the replacement text to your liking. "

"Countries are currently written to the tags as their ISO 3166-1 country "
"code, with some special values added for historical countries and things "
"like \\[Europe\\] or \\[Worldwide\\]. These codes are not always easily "
"recognizable or obvious, such as \"DZ\" for Algeria or \"DE\" for Germany. "
"You can of course use scripting to make these more readable. For example, if "
"you want to see \"United Kingdom\" instead of \"GB\" in this tag use:"

"This might work if you deal only with a couple of countries in your "
"collection, or you just want to handle some special cases like using "
"\"Europe\" instead of \"XE\" such as in the following script:"

"A simpler method would be to use the ``$countryname()`` function introduced "
"in Picard v2.7 to easily convert the code into a readable name, such as in "
"the following scripts:"
