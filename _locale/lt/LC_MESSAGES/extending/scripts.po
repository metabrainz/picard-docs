"There are two types of scripts used in Picard: the file naming script and "
"tagging scripts. These are managed from the \"File Naming\" and "
"\"Scripting\" sections of the :menuselection:`\"Options --> Options...\"` "
"menu. All scripts are written using the :doc:`Picard scripting language "
"<scripting>`. Scripts are often discussed in the `MetaBrainz Community Forum "

"and B) and an album with three tracks is loaded, the scripts will be "
