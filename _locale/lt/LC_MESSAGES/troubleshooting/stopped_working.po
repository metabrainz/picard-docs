msgid ""
"When processing a large number of files in one batch, Picard can run into "
"issues either due to processing each file (e.g.: AcoustID fingerprinting) or "
"during lookups following clustering or fingerprinting because of all of the "
"information requests to the MusicBrainz server API, as well as downloading "
"cover art. Even though Picard may still be working its way through the "
"backlog, the user interface may become non-responsive and appear that the "
"program has stalled or frozen."

msgid ""
"If you are processing a large library of files, it is generally more "
"effective to process smaller batches (e.g.: 200 files) at a time, first "
"retrieving the information using a cluster and lookup process, and then "
"processing any remaining unmatched files using the scan process. Please see "
"the :doc:`../usage/retrieve` section for more information."

msgid ""
"If you are processing files across a network connection, this can impact the "
"speed at which Picard works because of the speed difference between a "
"network connection and a local drive. In this case, the throughput can be "
"improved by first copying the source files to a local drive, process with "
"Picard, and then move the resulting files to the network drive."
