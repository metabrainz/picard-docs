If more than one marked subexpression is defined and matched, only the pattern captured by the first subexpression will be returned. If more than one marked subexpression is defined and not all are matched, an empty string will be returned.  If no subexpression is specified, then the pattern captured by the whole search expression will be returned."

msgid "When entering regular expressions into Picard scripts you have to escape a backslash \"\\\\\", dollar sign \"$\", comma \",\" and the left and right parentheses \"(\" and \")\" in order to force Picard to not interpret them as part of the script command.  This is done by inserting a backslash before the character to be escaped.  For example, the regular expression ``^\\s*([0-9,\\.]*)$`` would have to be entered as ``^\\\\s*\\([0-9\\,\\\\.]*\\)\\$``."
