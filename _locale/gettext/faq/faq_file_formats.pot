msgid "Please understand that Picard is not designed as a general purpose :index:`tag editor <tags; editing>`. Its primary goal is to retrieve community-maintained MusicBrainz data to write into your tags. Some secondary goals include:"

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:62
msgid "allowing rule-based customization of that data using scripts and plugins"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:63
msgid "encouraging users to create an account and fix and update data via the MusicBrainz website, thus sharing their work with the rest of the community rather than simply fixing their tags locally."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:65
msgid "To that end, Picard is likely to never have as much development focus on manual bulk editing of tags as other general purpose editors (e.g.: `Mp3tag <https://www.mp3tag.de/en/>`_, `foobar2000 <https://www.foobar2000.org/>`_, or even many library managers such as iTunes, Windows Media Player, and MediaMonkey).

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:82

msgid "**Windows:**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:86
msgid "The supported formats depend on the installed codecs. Depending on the Windows version certain codecs are pre-installed, but you can install additional codecs."

msgid "Acoustic fingerprinting in Picard uses a tool called :program:`fpcalc`, which is not available in Fedora. You can get it by installing the chromaprint-toolspackage from the `RPM Fusion repository <https://rpmfusion.org/>`_. This functionality is not contained in the main Fedora ``picard`` package because it requires the ``ffmpeg`` package which `cannot be distributed by Fedora <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Forbidden_items>`_.
