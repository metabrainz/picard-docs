#: ../../faq/faq_config.rst:34
msgid "First, you need to force iTunes to re-read the information from your tags and update its library. This is discussed in the `iTunes Guide <https://musicbrainz.org/doc/iTunes_Guide>`_."

#: ../../faq/faq_config.rst:37
msgid "Additionally, iTunes has a known bug in its ID3v2.4 implementation, which makes it unable to read such tags if they also contain embedded cover art. As a work-around, you can configure Picard to write ID3v2.3 tags."

msgid "**My tags are truncated to 30 characters in Windows Media Player!**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_config.rst:42
msgid "Prior to version 0.14, Picard's default settings were to write ID3v2.4 and ID3v1 tags to files. WMP can't read ID3v2.4, so it falls back to ID3v1 which has a limitation of 30 characters per title. To solve this on versions prior to 0.14, configure Picard to write ID3v2.3 tags instead."

#: ../../faq/faq_config.rst:46
msgid "Starting with version 0.14, the default settings have been changed to ID3v2.3 and this should no longer be an issue."
