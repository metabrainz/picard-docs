msgid "This provider uses the Cover Art Archive cover image assigned to the release group. This is usually the image that best describes the release group as a whole or the image with the best visual quality, but is not necessarily the exact cover of the release you are tagging. This provider is a good choice if you care more about visual quality then having an exact representation of your release. It is also a good fallback for the Cover Art Archive provider."

msgid "**Amazon**: Amazon often has cover art when other sites don't, however while this art is almost always for the correct Artist and Album, it may not be the absolute correct cover art for the specific Release with which you have tagged your music. *Note: The Amazon cover art provider was built-in in Picard 2.1.3 and earlier versions. For later versions it needs to be installed as a separate plugin.*"
