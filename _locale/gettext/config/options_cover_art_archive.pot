CAA images with an image type found in the \"Include\" list will be downloaded and used unless they also have an image type found in the \"Exclude\" list. Images with types found in the \"Exclude\" list will never be used. Image types not appearing in either the \"Include\" or \"Exclude\" lists will not be considered when determining whether or not to download and use a CAA image."

In this case, the cover may not match the exact release you are tagging (eg.: a 1979 vinyl front cover may be used in place of the Deluxe 2010 CD reissue)."
