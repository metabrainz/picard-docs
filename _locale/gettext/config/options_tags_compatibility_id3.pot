msgid "As mentioned above, ID3v2.3 does not support multi-value tags, and so Picard flattens these to strings before saving them to ID3v2.3 tags. This setting defines the string used to separate the values when flattened. Use '; ' for the greatest compatibility (rather than '/' since tags more often contain a '/' than a ';') and for the best visual compatibility in Picard between ID3v2.3 and other tagging formats."
msgstr ""

#: ../../config/options_tags_compatibility_id3.rst:25
msgid "This setting is explicitly only for ID3 v2.3 tags, because those don't support proper multi value tags. Hence this separator setting is actually more of a workaround to this fact."

#: ../../config/options_tags_compatibility_id3.rst:27
msgid "Because Vorbis tags allow the same tag to exist multiple times, and hence support multi valued tags by default, there actually is no separator at all there. It is just multiple values, shown using whatever the player software uses as a separator."
