msgid "A Disc ID is the code number which MusicBrainz uses to link a physical CD to a release listing. It is a string of letters, like ``XzPS7vW.HPHsYemQh0HBUGr8vuU-``.  Disc IDs for a release can be seen on the disc IDs tab for the release on MusicBrainz. Clicking on these will give a detailed display of the disc ID, including the list of attached releases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about_picard/glossary.rst:110
msgid "A release may have any number of disc IDs, and a disc ID may be linked to multiple releases. This is because `disc ID calculation <https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Disc_ID_Calculation>`_ involves a hash of the frame offsets of the CD tracks.  Different pressing of a CD often have slightly different frame offsets, and hence different disc IDs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about_picard/glossary.rst:115
msgid "Conversely, two different CDs may happen to have exactly the same set of frame offsets and hence the same disc ID.  For example ``lwHl8fGzJyLXQR33ug60E8jhf4k-`` applies to a wide `variety of releases <https://musicbrainz.org/cdtoc/lwHl8fGzJyLXQR33ug60E8jhf4k->`_ by a variety of artists."

Both release groups and releases are \"albums\" in a general sense, but with an important difference: a release is something you can buy as media such as a CD or a vinyl record, while a release group embraces the overall concept of an album — it doesn't matter how many CDs or editions / versions it had.  For example \"Sea of No Cares\" (release id: 4e4ba41e-24ae-3f57-87f6-3d8f19ae9483) is one version of the album in the `release group id 7e7ffd2b-3d1b-3487-aaaf-e4e6037f09ca <https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/7e7ffd2b-3d1b-3487-aaaf-e4e6037f09ca>`_ by Great Big Sea."
