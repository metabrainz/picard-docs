msgstr ""

#: ../../about_picard/glossary.rst:105
msgid "A Disc ID is the code number which MusicBrainz uses to link a physical CD to a release listing. It is a string of letters, like ``XzPS7vW.HPHsYemQh0HBUGr8vuU-``.  Disc IDs for a release can be seen on the disc IDs tab for the release on MusicBrainz. Clicking on these will give a detailed display of the disc ID, including the list of attached releases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about_picard/glossary.rst:110
msgid "A release may have any number of disc IDs, and a disc ID may be linked to multiple releases. This is because `disc ID calculation <https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Disc_ID_Calculation>`_ involves a hash of the frame offsets of the CD tracks.  Different pressing of a CD often have slightly different frame offsets, and hence different disc IDs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about_picard/glossary.rst:115
msgid "Conversely, two different CDs may happen to have exactly the same set of frame offsets and hence the same disc ID.  For example ``lwHl8fGzJyLXQR33ug60E8jhf4k-`` applies to a wide `variety of releases <https://musicbrainz.org/cdtoc/lwHl8fGzJyLXQR33ug60E8jhf4k->`_ by a variety of artists."

msgid "One of the physical, separate things you would get when you buy something in a record store. They are the individual CDs, vinyls, etc. contained within the packaging of an album (or any other type of release). Mediums are always included in a release, and have a position in said release (e.g. disc 1 or disc 2). They have a format like CD, 12\" vinyl or cassette (in some cases this will be unknown), and can have an optional title (e.g. disc 2: The Early Years).

msgid "Groups several different releases into a single logical entity. Every release belongs to one, and only one release group. Both release groups and releases are \"albums\" in a general sense, but with an important difference: a release is something you can buy as media such as a CD or a vinyl record, while a release group embraces the overall concept of an album — it doesn't matter how many CDs or editions / versions it had.  For example the `\"Sea of No Cares\" <https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/7e7ffd2b-3d1b-3487-aaaf-e4e6037f09ca>`_ release group contains multiple releases."
