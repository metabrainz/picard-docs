#: ../../extending/scripting.rst:33
msgid "The syntax is derived from `Foobar2000's titleformat <https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Foobar2000:Titleformat_Reference>`_. There are three base elements: text, variable and function. Variables consist of alphanumeric characters enclosed in percent signs (e.g.: ``%artist%``). Functions start with a dollar sign and end with an argument list enclosed in parentheses (e.g.: ``$lower(...)``)."
