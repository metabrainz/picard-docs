msgid "This option was added to Picard in version 2.8, and supports the use of log files produced by the popular CD file rippers `Exact Audio Copy (EAC) <http://exactaudiocopy.de/>`_ for Windows, `X Lossless Decoder (XLD) <https://tmkk.undo.jp/xld/index_e.html>`_ for macOS, and `Whipper <https://github.com/whipper-team/whipper>`_ for Linux.  Because the log files of these rippers contain sufficient information to generate the CD table of contents they can be used in place of reading the CD. As with reading the CD itself, this method provides the greatest chance of tagging your music files with the most accurate match from the MusicBrainz database.  It is also one of the easier methods for looking up the release."

Before proceeding, please check to ensure that the release you select properly matches your CD (e.g.: release country, date and label, catalog number, barcode, media type, and cover art).  This is especially important if you are going to submit any information such as acoustic features to AcousticBrainz or AcoustID fingerprints."
