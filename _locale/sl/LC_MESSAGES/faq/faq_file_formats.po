#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:80
msgid "Please understand that Picard is not designed as a general purpose :index:`tag editor <tags; editing>`. Its primary goal is to retrieve community-maintained MusicBrainz data to write into your tags. Some secondary goals include:"

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:83
msgid "allowing rule-based customization of that data using scripts and plugins"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:84

msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:86
msgid "To that end, Picard is likely to never have as much development focus on manual bulk editing of tags as other general purpose editors (e.g.: `Mp3tag <https://www.mp3tag.de/en/>`_, `foobar2000 <https://www.foobar2000.org/>`_, or even many library managers such as iTunes, Windows Media Player, and MediaMonkey). That doesn't mean that the team won't welcome patches in this area!"

msgid "Why is saving files sometimes slow, but saving a second time much faster?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:94
msgid "In most file formats the tags are near the beginning of the file, before the actual music data.  If changed tags get written to the file and the newly written tags take more space than before the entire file needs to be rewritten. This is usually much slower than just rewriting part of the file containing the tags, especially for larger files and/or if the files are on a slow storage (e.g. a network share or slow external drive)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:99
msgid "To mitigate the issue most tagging software (including Picard) leaves some free space (the so called padding) after the tags and before the actual music data. If the newly written are only a bit larger than before this free space can be used instead of rewriting the entire files. Likewise if the newly written tags take less space than before this only leads to an increase in padding, avoiding rewriting the file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:104
msgid "This all means that when you add many tags to the files (or if there is no or only small padding) you experience slow writing speed. If you do only small changes or just remove and later re-add tags the writing is much faster."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:109
msgid "Why does Picard not use Vinyl style track numbers (e.g. A1, A2, ...) by default?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:111
msgid "For Vinyl releases the track numbers on MusicBrainz are usually entered as A1, A2, ..., B1, B2, ... and so on. Other releases might use even different more uncommon numbering schemes.  Yet Picard will by default always write decimal track numbers, starting with 1 for the first track on a medium."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:115
msgid "The main reason for this is that this is how track numbers are defined for most file formats.  The formats expect decimal numbers, and likewise music players might only expect decimal numbers when reading the files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:118
msgid "If you really want to you can use the scripting variable ``%_musicbrainz_tracknumber%`` which always holds the track number as it was entered in the MusicBrainz database.  The following script will set the tracknumber tag to the value as displayed in the MusicBrainz database:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:126
msgid "Please be aware that for MP4 files this will result in the track number not being saved, as the MP4 format does not allow for non integer values in this tag.  For other formats it depends on the playback software and devices you use if they can handle these non-standard track numbers."

msgid "I am using Fedora. Why doesn't :index:`acoustic fingerprinting <acoustic fingerprint, fingerprint; acoustic>` work?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:157
msgid "Acoustic fingerprinting in Picard uses a tool called :program:`fpcalc`, which is not available in Fedora. You can get it by installing the chromaprint-toolspackage from the `RPM Fusion repository <https://rpmfusion.org/>`_. This functionality is not contained in the main Fedora ``picard`` package because it requires the ``ffmpeg`` package which `cannot be distributed by Fedora <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Forbidden_items>`_.
