"When selecting the cover art image types, you can select the types to both "
"include and exclude from the download list. CAA images with an image type "

"have an image type found in the \"Exclude\" list. Images with types found in "
"the \"Exclude\" list will never be used. Image types not appearing in either "
"the \"Include\" or \"Exclude\" lists will not be considered when determining "
"whether or not to download and use a CAA image."

"1979 vinyl front cover may be used in place of the Deluxe 2010 CD reissue)."
