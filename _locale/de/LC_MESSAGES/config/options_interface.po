"Enabling this option will bypass the native directory selector and use Qt's "
"file dialog. This may be desirable since the native directory selector "
"generally doesn't allow you to select more than one directory. This applies "
"to the :menuselection:`\"File --> Add folder\"` dialog. The file browser "
"always allows multiple directory selection."
