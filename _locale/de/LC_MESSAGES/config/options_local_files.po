"The file names are defined using a regular expression. The default is ``^(?:"
"cover|folder|albumart)(.*)\\.(?:jpe?g|png|gif|tiff?)$`` which will load "
"files with the name \"cover\", \"folder\" or \"albumart\" and the file "
"extension \"jpg\", \"png\", \"gif\" or \"tiff\" (e.g.: \"folder.jpg\" or "
"\"cover.png\")."

"The first part of the regular expression is a non-capture group: ``(?:cover|"
"folder|albumart)``. Items listed in this group will not get captured and the "
"default (Front) type will apply."

"The second part of the regular expression is a group: ``(.*)``. This is the "
"real capture, so if the file names match any of the cover art types, they "
"will be tagged as such."

"A common mistake is to add all the types into the first (non-capture) group. "
"This means that all the regular file names would be thrown into the Front "
"type and cause unexpected results."
