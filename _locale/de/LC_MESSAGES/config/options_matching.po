#: ../../config/options_matching.rst:25
msgid ""
"This setting is used when a file is assigned to a release and Picard needs "
"to decide which track to assign it to. This happens on cluster lookup after "
"the release has been chosen, or if you manually drag files onto a loaded "
"release (as opposed to dragging it onto a track directly). If none of the "
"tracks gives a match above the threshold the file is moved into an "
"\"unmatched files\" section on that release."

#: ../../config/options_matching.rst:27
msgid ""
"If you have absolutely no metadata in your current files, and you are using "
"\"Scan\" to match tracks, you may find that you need to lower the value of "
"\"Minimal similarity for matching files to tracks\" in order for Picard to "
"match the files within a release. Otherwise you may find that Picard matches "
"the track to a release but then is not sure which track is correct; and "
"leaves it in an \"unmatched files\" group within that release."

"As a general rule, lowering the percentages may increase the chance of "
"finding a match at the risk of false positives and incorrect matches."
