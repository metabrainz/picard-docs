"Some plugins make a large number of web service calls to get additional "
"track-specific data such as performer and work relationships, so loading "
"a large number of albums and tracks could take a significant amount of "
"time.  The time concern can be partially addressed by operating a local "
"MusicBrainz server with the rate limiting disabled.  Please see the "
"`MusicBrainz Server <https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server>`_ "
"project on GitHub for additional information."
