"If you are re-tagging files previously tagged with Picard, and get this "
"error, the release has possibly been :index:`deleted <release; deleted>`. "
"Try to right-click and use the \"Lookup in browser\" option to view the "
"release on the website. If you can't find it, it may have been deleted. This "
"could be because you tagged a pending release that was voted down, or tagged "
"against a release that was deleted because editors decided it wasn't a valid "
"release. This can happen for homebrew compilations, bad torrent or pirate "
"rips, \"advance\" releases or very poorly added releases. Usually there will "
"be an alternate release you can tag against, which you can find by searching "
"or doing another clustered lookup from Picard. If you can't find a "
"replacement and believe it has been deleted unfairly, `submit a new release "
"<https://musicbrainz.org/doc/How_to_Add_a_Release>`_, supplying evidence of "
"the track listing and as much information as possible to prove it is genuine "
"and it may be accepted again."
