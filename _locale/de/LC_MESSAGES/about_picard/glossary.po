msgid ""
"A :index:`Disc ID <disc id>` is the code number which MusicBrainz uses to "

msgstr ""

#: ../../about_picard/glossary.rst:54
msgid ""
"A release may have any number of disc IDs, and a disc ID may be linked to "
"multiple releases. This is because `disc ID calculation <https://musicbrainz."
"org/doc/Disc_ID_Calculation>`_ involves a hash of the frame offsets of the "
"CD tracks. Different pressing of a CD often have slightly different frame "
"offsets, and hence different disc IDs."

"Conversely, two different CDs may happen to have exactly the same set of "

":index:`One <medium>` of the physical, separate things you would get when "
