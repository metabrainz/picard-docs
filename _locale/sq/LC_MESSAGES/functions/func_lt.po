"Returns \"1\" (True) if ``x`` is less than ``y`` using the comparison "
"specified in ``type``. Possible values of ``type`` are \"int\" (integer), "
"\"float\" (floating point), \"text\" (case-sensitive text), \"nocase\" (case-"
"insensitive text) and \"auto\" (automatically determine the type of "
"arguments provided), with \"auto\" used as the default comparison method if "
"``type`` is not specified. The \"auto\" type will use the first type that "
"applies to both arguments in the following order of preference: \"int\", "
"\"float\" and \"text\"."
