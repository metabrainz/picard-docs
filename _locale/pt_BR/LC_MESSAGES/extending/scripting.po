"The syntax is derived from `Foobar2000's titleformat <https://wiki."
"hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Foobar2000:Titleformat_Reference>`_. There "
"are three base elements: text, variable and function. Variables consist of "
"alphanumeric characters enclosed in percent signs (e.g.: ``%artist%``). "
"Functions start with a dollar sign and end with an argument list enclosed in "
"parentheses (e.g.: ``$lower(...)``)."

#: ../../extending/scripting.rst:33
msgid ""
"When entering input strings into Picard scripts you have to escape a "
"backslash \"\\\\\", dollar sign \"$\", comma \",\" and the left and right "
"parentheses \"(\" and \")\" in order to force Picard to not interpret them "
"as part of the script command.  This is done by inserting a backslash before "
"the character to be escaped.  For example, to set a tag value to "
"``($1,000,000)`` it would have to be entered as ``$set(test_tag,\\(\\"
"$1\\,000\\,000\\))``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../extending/scripting.rst:41
msgid ""
"Usually you can access the values of a tag by the proper variable name. For "
"example, if your tag is called \"rerecorded\" you can use ``%rerecorded%``. "
"But the hyphen is not a valid character for a script variable, so ``%re-"
"recorded%`` gives a syntax error. In cases like this you need to use ``"
"$get(re-recorded)``."
