"The browser integration allows you to load releases and recordings into "
"Picard directly from the MusicBrainz website. Once you have opened "
"musicbrainz.org in your browser from Picard, the website will show the green "
"tagger button |lookup_tagger| next to releases and recordings. Clicking on "
"this button will load the corresponding release or recording into Picard."

msgid ""
"By default Picard will limit access to the browser integration port to your "
"local machine. Deactivating this option will expose the port on your "
"network, allowing you to request Picard to load a specific release or "
"recording via the network. For example, this would be used for the `Picard "
"Barcode Scanner <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org."
"musicbrainz.picard.barcodescanner>`_ Android app."

"Only expose the port externally when you actually need it and only on "
"networks you trust. Exposing application ports via the network can open "
"potential security holes on your system."
