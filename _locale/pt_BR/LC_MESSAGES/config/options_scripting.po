"When the checkbox beside the script is checked, that script will be executed "

"Regardless of whether or not the script is executed automatically, it can "
"also be executed manually by right-clicking on an item in the clustering "
"pane (middle pane) or the tagging pane (right-hand pane) and selecting it "
"from the list displayed when :menuselection:`\"Run Scripts\"` is selected.  "
"If a cluster is selected in the middle pane or a release is selected in the "
"right-hand pane, the script will be executed for each track in the selected "
"cluster or release.  If only a single track or file is selected, then the "
"script will only be executed for that track or file."
