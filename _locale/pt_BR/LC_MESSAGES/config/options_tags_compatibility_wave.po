"In all cases Picard will write ID3 tags to the WAVE files. This is supported "
"by quite a few tools; however, it is not supported universally. Tools not "
"supporting ID3 tags should just ignore them. If possible, this is likely the "
"best option to have proper tags in WAVE files. For compatibility with "
"software that does not support ID3v2 tags, Picard can also save `Resource "
"Interchange File Format <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Resource_Interchange_File_Format>`_ (RIFF) INFO tags to WAVE files. RIFF "
"INFO is read and written only as an extra. If there are no existing ID3 "
"tags, the data from RIFF INFO will be used. When saving files, RIFF INFO "
"will be written in addition to the ID3v2 tags."

"This setting allows you to specify the encoding used for the RIFF INFO tags "
"written. The default setting is Windows-1252 encoding. Picard can also use "
"UTF-8 as an alternative, which allows for full language support, but it "
"depends on the software reading it. Typically, if the software supports "
"this, it will read the ID3 tags anyway so there is not much to be gained."
