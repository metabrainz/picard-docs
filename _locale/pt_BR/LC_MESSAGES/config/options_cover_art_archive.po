msgid "When selecting the cover art image types, you can select the types to both include and exclude from the download list. CAA images with an image type found in the \"Include\" list will be downloaded and used unless they also have an image type found in the \"Exclude\" list. Images with types found in the \"Exclude\" list will never be used. Image types not appearing in either the \"Include\" or \"Exclude\" lists will not be considered when determining whether or not to download and use a CAA image."

The fixed sizes are generated automatically from the full size image, provided that it is greater than or equal to the fixed size being generated.  The generated images are square and padded as required if the original image is not square."

msgid "Since Picard 1.3, you can also decide whether or not to use the image from the release group (if any) if no front image is found for the release. In this case, the cover may not match the exact release you are tagging (eg.: a 1979 vinyl front cover may be used in place of the Deluxe 2010 CD reissue)."
