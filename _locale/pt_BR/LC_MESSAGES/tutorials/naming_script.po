"Writing a script to organize and name your files is actually not that hard "
"-- just don't get intimidated by all the '$', '%' and parentheses. If you "
"can write down a pattern like \"**ARTIST - (YEAR) ALBUM NAME/TRACK - SONG "
"TITLE**\" of how you want the files and folders named, you can quite easily "
"translate this to the proper script."

"To get started, first open the :doc:`../config/options_filerenaming_editor`, "
"either by selecting :menuselection:`\"Options --> Open file naming script "
"editor...\"` from Picard's main menu bar or by clicking the :guilabel:`Edit "
"script...` button on the :doc:`../config/options_filerenaming` configuration "
"page. From this screen, you can start a new script for your work."

"Note that the use of a '/' in the formatting string separates the output "
"directory from the file name. The formatting string is allowed to contain "
"any number of '/' characters. Everything before the last '/' is the "
"directory location, and everything after the last '/' becomes the file's "
"name. In our example, we only have one '/' character, meaning that we will "
"have one directory level for the album which will contain the songs for that "
"album."

"First, let's have a look at what we need. You see a list of the available "
"tags in the :doc:`../variables/tags_basic` section. We want the **ARTIST** "
"name, so available tags for this could be ``albumartist`` or ``artist``. "
"This should be the name for an album folder, so ``albumartist`` sounds like "
"what we need. To get the actual value for a tag you need to enclose its name "
"in percent signs. So let's start:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/naming_script.rst:20
msgid ""
"Now we want the **YEAR**. There is no ``year`` tag, but there is ``date``. "
"Let's use this for now. If we want to add extra text like the \"**-**\" just "
"write it down. We need to be careful with the parentheses, because those are "
"special variables in scripting. We need to prefix them with a backslash. "
"Let's add this all:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/naming_script.rst:26
msgid "Now we want the **ALBUM NAME**. That's simple, just use ``album``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/naming_script.rst:32
msgid ""
"That takes care of the directory portion of the renaming. The next part is "
"the **TRACK** number and **SONG TITLE**. The track number is available as "
"``tracknumber`` and the title of the track is simply ``title``. Adding these "
"to our script we get:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/naming_script.rst:38
msgid ""
"You can see that this looks nearly like the pattern that we said we wanted "
"at the start. It's not perfect yet for a few reasons. What if there are 10 "
"or more tracks on the album and they don't sort properly in the directory "
"listing? Also, we get a full date instead of just the year. Finally, "
"sometimes if you tag existing files they might not have the ``albumartist`` "
"set, just ``artist``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/naming_script.rst:40
msgid ""
"Let's fix the track number first. We can take care of that by using the :ref:"
"`func_num` function to add a leading zero to the number shown for tracks 1 "
"through 9:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/naming_script.rst:46

"Now let's fix the **ARTIST**. We can fallback to using ``artist`` if "
"``albumartist`` is not available by using:"

#: ../../tutorials/naming_script.rst:52

"The :ref:`func_if2` function uses the first value that is not empty, so if "
"``albumartist`` is empty it uses ``artist`` instead."

msgid ""
"For the ``date`` tag the dates from MusicBrainz are always formatted as YYYY-"
"MM-DD. We only need the year, so let's get just the first 4 characters with "
"the :ref:`func_left` function:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/naming_script.rst:60
msgid ""
"What happens if there is no ``date`` tag information? Sometimes MusicBrainz "
"does not have the release date of an album set as it is not yet known or "
"hasn't been entered into the database. It would be great to omit the entire "
"date with the parentheses in this case. Let's use the :ref:`func_if` "
"function to check whether the date is set:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/naming_script.rst:66
msgid ""
"Alternately, we can enter a placeholder such a \"**0000**\" if the date is "
"missing:"

"And there you have it -- the final script for naming your files developed "
