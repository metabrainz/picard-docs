"Disc IDs are very useful for identifying CDs and allowing MusicBrainz to "

"Make sure the CD is inserted in the drive, and select :menuselection:"
"`\"Tools --> Lookup CD... --> (drive to use)\"`. The CD toc will be "
"calculated and sent to MusicBrainz. Alternately, you can use an EAC, XLD or "
"Whipper ripper log file to lookup the CD using the :menuselection:`\"Tools --"
"> Lookup CD --> From EAC / XLD / Whipper log file...\"` command. This will "
