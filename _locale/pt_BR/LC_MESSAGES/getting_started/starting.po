"Once Picard has been installed on your system, most of the time you will be "
"starting it by clicking an icon on your desktop or in a start menu. This "
"will run the program using the default location for the configuration file "
"and configured logging level. Picard can also be started from a command line "
"prompt with some overrides available. From the command line, you can also "
"specify files or directories to load into Picard for processing. Please see :"
"doc:`../appendices/command_line` for more details about the available "
"options."

"As of version 2.9, Picard will try to only run a single instance of the "
"program at a time. When the program is started, it checks to see if there is "
"another instance of that version, configuration file and plugin startup "
"status ``-P`` already running. If the same version is already running, any "
"files or directories specified on the command line of the new instance, "
"along with any executable commands specified with the ``-e`` or ``--exec`` "
"options will be passed to the already running instance for processing and "
"the new duplicate instance will be shut down. This allows batch processing "
"of files to be initiated automatically from other processes. If there is no "
"instance of that version already running, Picard will start normally."

"Additionally, Picard can be started in \"stand-alone\" mode, in which case "
"it neither sends information to an already running instance nor accepts "
"information from another instance."

"Instances started with command-line argument ``-s / --stand-alone`` always "

"If there is already an instance running when another instance is started "
"that doesn't result in a stand-alone instance, any of the command-line "
"overrides ``-d / --debug``, ``-M / --no-player`` or ``-N / --no-restore`` of "
"the new duplicate instance will be ignored, and only the specified files or "
"directories and executable commands (if any) will be passed to the running "
"instance for processing. Similarly, if a primary instance has been started "
"with any of these overrides specified on the command line, starting a "
"subsequent instance of that version without the override will not modify the "
"user interface settings of the currently running instance."

"All instances started with the ``-h / --help``, ``-v / --version`` or ``-V / "
"--long-version`` command line arguments will always output the requested "
