"This indicates an error occurred during saving. In the majority of times "
"people see this it is because the files they want to save are write "
"protected (either have the readonly flag set or have wrong permissions).  "
"Check that the files are not write protected and that you have the "
"appropriate permissions before trying again."

"Permission problems seem to be more common when Picard has been installed "

"A third possibility, although very rare, is that you are trying to set a tag "

"try reviewing all of the tags to be written to see if there are any that "
