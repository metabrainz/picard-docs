"If you find that Picard won't start there are a few common possible reasons, "
"and things to try to correct the issue. Before doing anything drastic, it is "
"recommended that you try to start Picard from the command line with the :"
"option:`-d` option to generate the debug logging.  This process is described "
"in the :doc:`troubleshooting` section.  If the resulting logs don't provide "
"any clues as to the problem, it may be one of the following:"

"If you suspect that this may be the problem, the first (and simplest) thing "
"to try is to reinstall the program.  This should address any potential file "
"corruption issues.  If Picard still won't start then it is unlikely that "
"this was the problem."

"To check whether one of the plugin files has become corrupted or, in the "
"case of a recent upgrade to a plugin or Picard, a plugin is not compatible, "
"you should try removing all of the plugins and then start Picard.  Since you "
"won't be able to disable or remove the plugins using Picard's 'Option' "
"settings, you will need to remove them manually.  The plugins may be located "
"in a ``plugins`` subdirectory of the directory where the Picard program file "
"is stored, or in a user-specific directory:"

"If this problem started just after updating Picard, in spite of all the "
"testing that is performed prior to releasing a new version, it may be "
"possible that this is indeed a bug.  In that case, you should first try to "
"reinstall the previous version to ensure that it works and that the problem "
"is only occurring with the new version.  Then you should report the issue, "
"following the steps outlined in the \"Reporting a Bug\" topic of the :doc:"
"`troubleshooting` section.  Please be sure to include as much information as "
"possible, which will help the developers to locate and fix the problem."
