:index:`Scripting <scripts>`
=============================

Scripts are used to control some aspects of the operation of Picard.

There are two types of scripts used in Picard: the file naming script and tagging scripts.
These are managed from the "File Naming" and "Scripting" sections of the
:menuselection:`"Options --> Options..."` menu.

Scripts are often discussed in the `MetaBrainz Community Forum <https://community.metabrainz.org/>`_,
and there is a thread specific to `file naming and script snippets
<https://community.metabrainz.org/t/repository-for-neat-file-name-string-patterns-and-tagger-script-snippets/2786/>`_.

   Please refer to the section on :doc:`Scripts <scripts>` in :doc:`Extending Picard <extending>`
   for additional details about the two types of scripts, including how and when each of the scripts are executed.

:index:`Syntax <scripts; syntax>`
----------------------------------

The syntax is derived from `Foobar2000's titleformat
<https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Foobar2000:Titleformat_Reference>`_.
There are three base elements: text, variable and function. Variables consist of
alphanumeric characters enclosed in percent signs (e.g.: ``%artist%``). Functions
start with a dollar sign and end with an argument list enclosed in parentheses (e.g.:
``$lower(...)``).

.. note::

   When entering input strings into Picard scripts you have to escape a backslash "\\",
   dollar sign "$", comma "," and the left and right parentheses "(" and ")" in order to force
   Picard to not interpret them as part of the script command.  This is done by inserting
   a backslash before the character to be escaped.  For example, to set a tag value to ``($1,000,000)``
   it would have to be entered as ``$set(test_tag,\(\$1\,000\,000\))``.

Metadata Variables
------------------

See :doc:`../variables/variables` for the list of the variables provided by Picard.

Picard's variables can be either simple variables containing a single text
string, or multi-value variables containing multiple text strings. In scripts, multi-value
variables are automatically converted to a single text string by joining the values with a
semicolon ";", except when used with special multi-value functions.
