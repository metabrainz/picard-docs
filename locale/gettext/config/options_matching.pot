msgid "If you have absolutely no metadata in your current files, and you are using \"Scan\" to match tracks, you may find that you need to lower the value of \"Minimal similarity for matching files to tracks\" in order for Picard to match the files within a release. Otherwise you may find that Picard matches the track to a release but then is not sure which track is correct; and leaves it in an \"unmatched files\" group within that release."

msgid "As a general rule, lowering the percentages may increase the chance of finding a match at the risk of false positives and incorrect matches."
