msgstr ""

#: ../../source/config/options_advanced.rst:31

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/config/options_advanced.rst:36
msgid "Missing tracks of the selected type (i.e.: video, pregap, data or silence) will be ignored when determining whether a release is considered to be complete. For example, if \"video\" is selected then a release with a bonus video will be marked as complete if it has all the audio tracks matched with a file even if the video file is missing."

If the only difference between the file's metadata and the metadata retrieved from MusicBrainz is a tag listed in this ignore list then the file will be considered unmodified."

Once you have opened musicbrainz.org in your browser from Picard, the website will show the green tagger button |lookup_tagger| next to releases and recordings.  Clicking on this button will load the corresponding release or recording into Picard."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/config/options_advanced.rst:73
msgid "By default Picard will limit access to the browser integration port to your local machine. Deactivating this option will expose the port on your network, allowing you to request Picard to load a specific release or recording via the network. For example, this would be used for the `Picard Barcode Scanner <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.musicbrainz.picard.barcodescanner>`_ Android app."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/config/options_advanced.rst:106
msgid "If you have absolutely no metadata in your current files, and you are using \"Scan\" to match tracks, you may find that you need to lower the value of \"Minimal similarity for matching files to tracks\" in order for Picard to match the files within a release. Otherwise you may find that Picard matches the track to a release but then is not sure which track is correct; and leaves it in an \"unmatched files\" group within that release."

#: ../../source/config/options_advanced.rst:112
msgid "As a general rule, lowering the percentages may increase the chance of finding a match at the risk of false positives and incorrect matches."
