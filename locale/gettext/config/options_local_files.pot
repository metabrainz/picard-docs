msgid "The file names are defined using a regular expression. The default is ``^(?:cover|folder|albumart)(.*)\\.(?:jpe?g|png|gif|tiff?)$`` which will load files with the name \"cover\", \"folder\" or \"albumart\" and the file extension \"jpg\", \"png\", \"gif\" or \"tiff\" (e.g.: \"folder.jpg\" or \"cover.png\")."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/config/options_local_files.rst:25
msgid "The first part of the regular expression is a non-capture group: ``(?:cover|folder|albumart)``.  Items listed in this group will not get captured and the default (Front) type will apply."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/config/options_local_files.rst:28
msgid "The second part of the regular expression is a group: ``(.*)``. This is the real capture, so if the file names match any of the cover art types, they will be tagged as such."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/config/options_local_files.rst:33
msgid "A common mistake is to add all the types into the first (non-capture) group. This means that all the regular file names would be thrown into the Front type and cause unexpected results."
