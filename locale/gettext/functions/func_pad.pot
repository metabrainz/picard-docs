msgid "Pads the ``text`` to the ``length`` provided by adding as many copies of ``char`` as needed to the beginning of the string.  For the padded length to be correct, ``char`` must be exactly one character in length.  If ``length`` is less than the number of characters in ``text``, the function will return ``text``.  If ``length`` is missing or is not a number, the function will return an empty string."
