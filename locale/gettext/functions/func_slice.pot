msgid "Returns a multi-value variable containing the elements from the ``start`` index up to but not including the ``end`` index from the multi-value variable ``name``. A literal value representing a multi-value can be substituted for ``name``, using the ``separator`` (or a semicolon followed by a space \"; \" if not passed) to coerce the value into a proper multi-valued variable."

msgid "A typical use might be to create a multi-value variable with all artists in ``%artists%`` except the first, which can be used to create a \"feat.\" list.  This would look something like ``$setmulti(supporting_artists,$slice(%artists%,1,))``."
