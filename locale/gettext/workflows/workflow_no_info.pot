msgid "This is perhaps the worst case scenario, because it provides the greatest chance of tagging your music files with an incorrect match from the MusicBrainz database."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/workflows/workflow_no_info.rst:13
msgid "In this situation, you will need to feed batches of files to Picard to process.  In order to minimize the performance impact, it is recommended to keep the batches relatively small (i.e.: approximately 200 files at most in a single batch).  Picard will try to group them into clusters based on their AcoustID fingerprints."

#: ../../source/workflows/workflow_no_info.rst:19
msgid "This workflow will likely only partially match the files to a release in each batch processed.  This means that an album may not be fully matched, tagged and renamed until multiple batches have been processed."

Picard will attempt to calculate the AcoustID fingerprint for each of the files and then retrieve releases with matching recordings.  See the :doc:`../usage/retrieve_scan` section for details."

The release icon will likely remain silver, indicating that not all tracks have been matched to files.  See the :doc:`../usage/match` section for details."
