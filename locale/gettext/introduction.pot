msgid "MusicBrainz Picard is a cross-platform music file tagger.  This User Guide is intended to augment the information provided on the `Picard website <https://picard.musicbrainz.org/>`_ and to provide an alternate format for the documentation, including a PDF document suitable for printing.  Links to additional information such as scripts, plugins and tutorials are provided when available rather than trying to reproduce the information in this document."

msgid "In order to effectively use Picard, it is important to understand what the program can do and, equally important, what it cannot do.  What Picard does, it does very well, but if you're expecting it to automatically organize your collection of thousands of random music files you will likely be disappointed.  To quote from the Picard website, *\"Picard is not built to be a mass single-track tag fixer. Picard believes in quality over quantity and provides a plethora of customizations to tweak music collections to your needs.\"*"

msgid "Picard currently supports most music file formats, with two notable exceptions: Matroska (.mka) and Windows WAVE (.wav).  WAVs cannot be tagged due to the lack of a standard for doing so, however, they can be fingerprinted and renamed.  In addition, Picard does not support writing custom tags for all formats.  The `Picard Tag Mappings <https://picard.musicbrainz.org/docs/mappings/>`_ webpage provides more information regarding the mapping between Picard internal tag names and various tagging formats."

msgid "**Request Rate Limiting**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/introduction.rst:67
msgid "Picard's metadata retrieval is limited to the standard **one request per second** rate limiting for the MusicBrainz API.  This becomes quite noticable when trying to process a large list of files, and is exacerbated by extensions that perform additional information requests from the database."

msgid "**Network File Processing**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/introduction.rst:73
msgid "Sometimes Picard needs to rewrite the entire music file in order to add or update the tags.  This can take a few seconds, and the delay becomes even longer if the file is accessed across a network (e.g.: file is read from or written to a NAS device).  The recommended \"best practice\" is to process all files on a local drive and then move them to the desired remote directory once processing is complete."
