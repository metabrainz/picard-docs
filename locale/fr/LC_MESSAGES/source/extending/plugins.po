"Plugins are written in Python, and are registered to the appropriate "
"hooks.  Each plugin has its own version identifier, but also lists the "
"plugin API versions that it supports. When loading a plugin, Picard first"
" compares its list of API versions to the plugin’s supported versions to "
"ensure that the plugin will operate correctly.  The Picard API versions "
"indicate the version of the program in which the plugin API was last "
"updated and any plugin APIs with which it is backwards compatible."

"Hooks are connections to the various objects in Picard that call a "
"specific type of plugin. During the normal running of Picard, when it "
"encounters a hook it will first retrieve a list of all plugins registered"
" for that specific hook, and then execute them sequentially in order "
"based upon the priority specified when the plugin was registered to the "
"hook."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/extending/plugins.rst:26
msgid ""
"**Metadata processors**: These plugins can access and modify the metadata"
" when it is loaded from MusicBrainz. They are registered with "
"``register_album_metadata_processor()`` or "
"``register_track_metadata_processor()``.  These are what you might call "
"\"automatic\" because they operate without any user intervention.  An "
"example is the Classical Extras plugin."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/extending/plugins.rst:31
msgid ""
"**Cover art providers**: These plugins provide another cover art source, "
"and are registered with ``register_cover_art_provider()``. They are also "
"\"automatic\" in that they load album art without user intervention, "
"although they must be enabled by the user in the Cover Art options. The "
"Fanart.tv plugin is an example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/extending/plugins.rst:36
msgid ""
"**Scripting function**: Some plugins just provide additional scripting "
"functions for use in Options > Scripting or the renaming script. These "
"are registered with ``register_script_function()``.  Keep tag, which "
"provides the ``$keep()`` function, is an example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/extending/plugins.rst:40
msgid ""
"**Context menu actions**: Plugins can register actions that can be "
"activated manually via the context menu. This is what the Load as non-"
"album track plugin does. Another example is Generate Cuesheet.  These are"
" registered with ``register_album_action()``, "
"``register_track_action()``, ``register_file_action()``, "
"``register_cluster_action()`` or ``register_clusterlist_action()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/extending/plugins.rst:45
msgid ""
"**File formats**: Plugins can also provide support for new file formats "
"not yet supported by Picard.  These are registered with "
"``register_format()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/extending/plugins.rst:48
msgid ""
"**Event processors**: Plugins can execute automatically based on certain "
"event triggers. These are registered with ``file_post_load_processor()``,"
" ``file_post_save_processor()``, "
"``file_post_addition_to_track_processor()``, "
"``file_post_removal_from_track_processor()`` or "
"``album_post_removal_processor()``."

"Note that plugins are not limited to one of those areas.  A single plugin"
" could implement all of the above, but most existing plugins focus on "
"one."

"The :doc:`Plugins API <../technical/plugins_api>` provides information "
"regarding the different plugin hooks available, along with some examples "
"of their use.  There is also a list of the `available plugins "
"<https://picard.musicbrainz.org/plugins/>`_ that have been submitted to "
"the MusicBrainz Picard repository shown on the Picard website."
