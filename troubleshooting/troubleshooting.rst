* What actually happened, and what did you expect to happen?

:index:`Getting a Debug Log <troubleshooting; get debug log>`
-------------------------------------------------------------

For many bugs, it helps developers to have a debug log from Picard. You can see the log by going to :menuselection:`"Help --> View Log"`. You can also get a full debug log, which is better because it contains more detailed information. Pasting this log into your forum post or bug ticket can help developers and other users to resolve your issue more quickly. To retrieve the full debug log:

1. Start Picard.
2. Open the log view with :menuselection:`"Help --> View Log"`.
3. Change the log level :guilabel:`verbosity` to **Debug**.
4. Close the log viewer.
5. Close and restart Picard.
6. Repeat the action that caused the problem being reported.
7. Open the log viewer and copy the output to paste into the forum post or bug ticket. Alternately, you can save the log to a file to attach to your bug report by using the :guilabel:`Save As...` button.
8. Close the log viewer, and close Picard.


:index:`Getting Logs in Case of Crashes <troubleshooting; getting log for crashes>`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases the problem will cause Picard to crash and not allow you to access the resulting log from the log viewer. You can still generate a log output to attach to your report by starting Picard with the ``--debug`` command line option from a command / terminal window and copying the log output information from the terminal. The steps to follow for each of the supported platforms are:

Windows Systems
+++++++++++++++

First open a command window by clicking the search icon on the Windows Taskbar and enter "cmd". Then start Picard by entering the following in the command window:

.. code::

   "C:\Program Files\MusicBrainz Picard\picard.exe" --debug

This will display all log entries in the command window, and allow you to copy the information to the clipboard to paste into your report.

.. note::

   This method will only work with the installed version of Picard.  It will not work with the portable or Windows Store versions.


macOS Systems
+++++++++++++

First open a terminal window by doing one of the following:

- Click the Launchpad icon in the Dock, type "Terminal" in the search field, then click :guilabel:`Terminal`.

- In the Finder, open the "/Applications/Utilities" folder, then double-click "Terminal".

Assuming Picard was put into the system wide Applications folder when installed, it can then be started by entering the following in the terminal window:

.. code::

   "/Applications/MusicBrainz Picard.app/Contents/MacOS/picard-run" --debug

This will display all log entries in the terminal window, and allow you to copy the information to the clipboard to paste into your report.


Linux Systems
+++++++++++++

First open a Terminal window in your desktop environment, either from the Applications menu or by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl+Alt+T` on most systems. Then start Picard by entering the following in the terminal window:

.. code::

   picard --debug

This will display all log entries in the terminal window, and allow you to copy the information to the clipboard to paste into your report.
