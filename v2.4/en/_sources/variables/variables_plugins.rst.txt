.. note::

   Some plugins make a large number of web service calls to get additional track-specific data such as performer and work relationships,
   so loading a large number of albums and tracks could take a significant amount of time.  The time concern can be partially addressed by
   operating a local MusicBrainz server with the rate limiting disabled.  Please see the `MusicBrainz Server <https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server>`_
   project on GitHub for additional information.
