   :width: 100 %

**Server address**

   The domain name for the MusicBrainz database server used by Picard to get details of your music.
   Default value: musicbrainz.org (for the main MusicBrainz server).

**Port**

   The port number for the server. Default value: 80 (for the main MusicBrainz server).

**Username**

   Your MusicBrainz website username, used to submit acoustic fingerprints, retrieve and save items
   to your collections, and retrieve personal folksonomy tags.

**Password**

   Your MusicBrainz website password.

**Automatically scan all new files**

   Check this box if you want Picard to scan each music file you add and look for an AcoustID
   fingerprint. This takes time, but may be helpful for you and MusicBrainz. Leave it unchecked
   if you don't want Picard to do this scan automatically. In any case, you can direct Picard to
   scan a particular music file at any time using :menuselection:`"Tools --> Scan"`.

**Ignore MBIDs when loading new files**

   If you disable this option Picard will not use MusicBrainz identifiers (MBIDs) stored in the
   files to automatically load the corresponding MusicBrainz release and match the loaded file to
   the correct track.  This is useful when re-processing files that have been previously tagged
   with incorrect information.

.. index::
   pair: configuration; update checking

**Check for updates during start-up**

   This option determines whether or not Picard will automatically check for program updates during
   startup.  In any case, you can have Picard check for program updates at any time using :menuselection:`"Help
   --> Check for update"`.

**Days between checks**

   This option allows you to limit the automatic update checking by selecting the interval, in days,
   between checks. Set this to 1 if you want to check daily, 7 for weekly checks, and so on. Note that
   this only applies if the "Check for updates during start-up" option is enabled.

**Updates to check**

   This option allows you to select which levels of update to check. Your options are:

   * Stable releases only
   * Stable and Beta releases
   * Stable, Beta and Dev releases

   For example, if you subscribe to "Stable releases only" you will not be notified if a new Beta or
   Dev release is issued.

.. note::

   The update checking related settings and :menuselection:`"Help --> Check for update..."` command may
   not be available when Picard is distributed as a package. In that case, the user should check with the
   maintainer of the package to determine when an update is available.
