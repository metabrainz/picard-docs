Picard can download Cover Art from a number of sources, and you can choose which sources you want Picard to
use. You can activate more than one provider and choose the order in which the providers
are queried. Picard will try the providers from top to bottom until an image is returned.

**Cover Art Archive**

   The Cover Art Archive (CAA) is the MusicBrainz archive of cover art in cooperation with the `Internet
   Archive <https://archive.org>`_. The Cover Art Archive is the most comprehensive database of cover art
   (e.g.: front covers, back covers, booklets, CDs).

**CAA Release Group**

   This provider uses the Cover Art Archive cover image assigned to the release group. This is usually the
   image that best describes the release group as a whole or the image with the best visual quality, but is
   not necessarily the exact cover of the release you are tagging. This provider is a good choice if you
   care more about visual quality then having an exact representation of your release. It is also a good
   fallback for the Cover Art Archive provider.

**Sites on the whitelist**

   This will use images provided from whitelisted sites. See `Cover art whitelist
   <https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/History:Style/Relationships/URLs/Cover_art_whitelist>`_ in the Style Guide
   for more information.

   .. note::

      CD Baby and other whitelist sites are no longer being used by MusicBrainz for new Cover Art.

**Local Files**

   Load cover art from local files. The file names to load can be configured in the :ref:`ref-local-files` provider options.

In addition to the built-in cover art providers described above, additional cover art providers can be installed as `plugins
<https://picard.musicbrainz.org/plugins/>`_.

   * **Amazon**: Amazon often has cover art when other sites don't, however while this art is almost always for the correct
     Artist and Album, it may not be the absolute correct cover art for the specific Release with which you have tagged your music.
     *Note: The Amazon cover art provider was built-in in Picard 2.1.3 and earlier versions. For later versions it needs to be
     installed as a separate plugin.*

   * **fanart.tv**: Uses cover art from `fanart.tv <https://fanart.tv/>`_, which focuses on cover art with high visual quality.
     This provider provides cover art representative for the release group and not the individual release.

   * **TheAudioDB**: Uses cover art from `TheAudioDB <https://www.theaudiodb.com/>`_, which focuses on cover art with high visual
     quality. This provider provides cover art representative for the release group and not the individual release.
