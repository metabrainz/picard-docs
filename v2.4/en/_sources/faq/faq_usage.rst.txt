Using Picard
============

**How do I tag files with Picard?**

   There is a separate section that explains the tagging process.  Please see :doc:`../usage/using` for details.

.. index::
   single: tagger icon
   single: icon; tagger

**The green "Tagger" icon disappeared from MusicBrainz.org, how do I get it back?**

   This icon shows up when a manual lookup is performed via Picard using :menuselection:`"Tools --> Lookup"`.

   Alternatively the parameter ``?tport=8000`` can be added to the end of almost any MusicBrainz URL and the green
   tagger icons will continue to show up from then on.

**I'm trying to load a release in Picard, but all I'm seeing is "Couldn't load album errors". What's up?**

   If you get "Couldn't load album errors" for releases in Picard, this can occur for a number of reasons. Check the
   following:

   **1. Is the problem persistent for a given release?**

      Try waiting a minute or two, or even a bit longer and then try again with a right-click, "Refresh". Sometimes
      the servers are just overloaded and temporarily reject requests.

   **2. Has the release been deleted from MusicBrainz?**

      If you are re-tagging files previously tagged with Picard, and get this error, the release has possibly been
      deleted. Try to right-click and use the "Lookup in browser" option to view the release on the website. If you can't
      find it, it may have been deleted. This could be because you tagged a pending release that was voted down, or tagged
      against a release that was deleted because editors decided it wasn't a valid release. This can happen for homebrew
      compilations, bad torrent or pirate rips, "advance" releases or very poorly added releases. Usually there will be an
      alternate release you can tag against, which you can find by searching or doing another clustered lookup from Picard.
      If you can't find a replacement and believe it has been deleted unfairly, `submit a new release
      <https://musicbrainz.org/doc/How_to_Add_a_Release>`_, supplying evidence of the tracklisting and as much information
      as possible to prove it is genuine and it may be accepted again.

**I'm using macOS, where are my network folders or drives?**

   These should show up in the add file and add folder dialogs, but they aren't visible by default in the file browser
   pane. If you want to see them in the file browser pane, right click in the pane and select "show hidden files". They
   should then be visible in the /Volumes folder.
