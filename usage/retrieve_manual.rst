Manual Lookup
=============

The steps to follow to manually lookup an album on MusicBrainz are:

Step 1
-------

Add your files using :menuselection:`"Files --> Add Files..."` or :menuselection:`"Files --> Add Folder..."`.

For ease of use it is recommended to use the internal File Browser to manage file system interactions. This is enabled from :menuselection:`"View --> File Browser"`.

Step 2
-------

Drag the selected directory or files to the "Unclustered Files" folder, and wait for Picard to process the files - the names will turn from grey to black.

Step 3
-------

Enter your search information into the search box and select the type of records to search, then click the magnifying glass symbol to initiate the search. This will open the `MusicBrainz website <https://musicbrainz.org>`_ in your browser.

.. note::

   If you enter a link to the desired entry (e.g.: ``https://musicbrainz.org/release/9383a6f5-9607-4a36-9c68-8663aad3592b``) in the search box in Picard, the entry will be loaded directly without opening a browser window.
