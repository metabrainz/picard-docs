The steps to follow to :index:`lookup files` are:

1. Add your files using :menuselection:`"Files --> Add Files..."` or :menuselection:`"Files --> Add Folder..."`.
   For ease of use it is recommended to use the internal File Browser to manage file system interactions.  This is
   enabled from :menuselection:`"View --> File Browser"`.

2. Drag the selected directory or files to the "Unclustered Files" folder, and wait for Picard to process the files -
   the names will turn from grey to black.

3. Use :menuselection:`"Tools --> Cluster"` to group the files into album :index:`clusters <pair: cluster; lookup>`.

4. Select a clustered album and use :menuselection:`"Tools --> Lookup"` to lookup the cluster. Depending on your previous
   metadata, the album will show up in the right-hand pane.

   A music symbol in front of a track number in the right-hand pane indicates that there has been no file assigned to the track.

   If no album was retrieved, or if the album retrieved was incorrect, you may have to try a different method such as scanning
   the files or a manual lookup.
