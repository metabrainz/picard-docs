Configuration
=============

.. index::
   single: configuration; config file location

**Where is the Picard configuration saved?**

   Picard saves the configuration in the file ``Picard.ini``. Its location depends on the operating system:

   **Windows:**

      ``%APPDATA%\MusicBrainz\Picard.ini``

      This usually will be ``C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\MusicBrainz``, where ``YourUserName`` should be replaced with your
      actual Windows user name.

   **macOS, Linux and other Unix like systems:**

      ``$HOME/.config/MusicBrainz/Picard.ini``

   single: itunes

**I tagged a file in Picard, but iTunes is not seeing the tags!**

   First, you need to force iTunes to re-read the information from your tags and update its library. This is discussed in the `iTunes
   Guide <https://musicbrainz.org/doc/iTunes_Guide>`_.

   Additionally, iTunes has a known bug in its ID3v2.4 implementation, which makes it unable to read such tags if they also contain
   embedded cover art. As a work-around, you can configure Picard to write ID3v2.3 tags.

**My tags are truncated to 30 characters in Windows Media Player!**

   Prior to version 0.14, Picard's default settings were to write ID3v2.4 and ID3v1 tags to files. WMP can't read ID3v2.4, so it falls
   back to ID3v1 which has a limitation of 30 characters per title. To solve this on versions prior to 0.14, configure Picard to write
   ID3v2.3 tags instead.

   Starting with version 0.14, the default settings have been changed to ID3v2.3 and this should no longer be an issue.

.. index::
   pair: configuration; browser

**How do I tell Picard which browser to use?**

   On Windows, macOS, GNOME and KDE, Picard uses the default browser that has been configured for the system. On other systems, you can
   use the ``BROWSER`` environment variable.

   For example::

      export BROWSER="firefox '%s' &"

   Another approach that works in some GNU/Linux systems is the following command::

      sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser

   This should present you with a list of existing browsers in your system, allowing you to select the one to use by default.
